Question 1
How do Convolutions improve image recognition?
They isolate features in images
Correct
Spot on! Additionally, a properly designed convolution layer can even make training faster.
2.
Question 2
What does the Pooling technique do to the images?

1 / 1 point

Reduces information in them while maintaining some features
 Pooling reduces information without removing all of the features.
 
 3.
Question 3
True or  False. If you pass a 28x28 image through a 3x3 filter the output will be 26x26

1 / 1 point

True

4.
Question 4
After max pooling a 26x26 image with a 2x2 filter, the output will be 56x56

False
Yes! The output would actually be 13x13


Question 5
How does using Convolutions in our Deep neural network impact training?


Its impact will depend on other factors.
Correct! Using convolutions might make your training faster or slower, and a poorly designed Convolutional layer may even be less efficient than a plain DNN!
